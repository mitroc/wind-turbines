## Large Wind Turbines - Poland

### Note
* I get voices that the code is qute messy. Indeed it is, I agree. I'm learning while making that site, so I rather wanted the app to work (kind of MVP) than to have a pure and clean code. ~~But I promise I'll refactor it soon. :-)~~

### What is this repository for? ###
* This project presents **large wind turbines** (tip height 100 m and more, with some exceptions as seen in the database) installed in Poland and reported by investors to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as aeronautical obstacles.

* Data is presented with Google Maps Api and CAA ArcGis Api in the form of a **heatmap**, **clusters** and **individual** objects. Some basic calculations on the database are performed and results displayed on the map.

### How do I get set up? ###
* No setup necessary. Just clone and open.
* Or check the working version
