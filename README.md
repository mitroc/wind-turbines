### What is this repository for? ###
* This project presents **large wind turbines** (tip height 100 m and more, with some exceptions as seen in the database) installed in Poland and reported by investors to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as aeronautical obstacles.

* Data is presented with Google Maps Api and CAA ArcGis Api in the form of a **heatmap**, **clusters** and **individual** objects. Some basic calculations on the database are performed and results displayed on the map.

### How do I get set up? ###
* No setup necessary. Just clone and open.
* Or check the working version here: http://codepen.io/mitroc/full/mmjBYv/

### Contribution guidelines ###
* The code itself is in learn/develop phase but a kind of MVP feature is ensured. As the author is new to programming, any comments, guides and review is appreciated. Face to face code review (3city, Poland) - the beer is on me :-).
